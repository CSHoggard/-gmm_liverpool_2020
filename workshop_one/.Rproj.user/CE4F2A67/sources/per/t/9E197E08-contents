# What are we going to do today?

I will introduce the subject of geometric morphometrics (GMM), specifically:

1. Shape and shape theory

2. Advantages (and disadvantages) of using GMM

3. History of GMM

4. How we 'do' GMM (data creation, transformation, analysis and visualisation)

# Morphometrics 101

* Term: Professor of Zoology Robert Blackith (1957)

* Quantitative study of shape, shape variation and shape covariation

* Two types of morphometric studies:

  - Traditional morphometrics (length measurements, angles, ratios‚Ä¶)
  
  - Geometric morphometrics or GMM  (landmarks, outlines, curves, surfaces‚Ä¶)

# Benefits and Drawbacks

.pull-left[###üëç Benefits üëç
- Degree of **shape resolution**

- **Information loss**  (vs. linear measurements)

- **Data can easily be collected** from methods including photographs, drawings and scans

- Abstraction and registration procedure allow an analysis of **shape *sensu stricto***

- Useful **visualisation** tool]

.pull-right[### üëé Drawbacks üëé
- Required **skill level** (software, statistics...)

- **Proceduralisation** (R is helping!)

- **Landmark subjectivity**]

# We can use GMM to determine whether‚Ä¶

#### two or more assemblages are different in shape?

#### shape is related to: size? sex? raw material? hominin?

#### shape differences correspond to a hypothesis or a model?

#### mean or median shapes are representative of a site?

#### there are biologically inherent relationships?

#### networks of specific shapes can be identified? (over several sites)

# Stage 2: Landmark Choice

* Landmarks are central to GMM

* Definition: a coordinate point used to represent a shape <br> and/or a homologous point on a structure <br/>

* Quantifiable as Cartesian coordinates (x, y / z coordinates)

* Flexibility in what types of landmark are required

* Can be treated as individual points [workshop two] <br> or converted into curves and outlines [workshop three] <br/>

# Stage 2: Landmark Choice

#### Various types of landmarks
* Type I: Homologous biological structures
* Type II: Geometric definition e.g. greatest curvature
* Type III: Point with reference to another point

#### A special case: semi-landmarks 
* Placed using an algorithm
* Can cover the whole or part of a shape
* Equidistant and placed between one or two end points
* A special Type III landmark (*sensu* Bookstein)

# Stage 2: Landmark Choice

#### Landmarks should...

* sample aspects which are of archaeological interest

* be repeatable and identifiable on all examples (if possible)

* cover as much of the shape as possible

* be sufficient as to not increase the ‚Äòweighting of areas‚Äô

* always be plotted in the same order!

# Stage 4: Data screening

* Do all my specimens have the **correct number of points**?

* Are all my landmarks in the **correct order**?

* Are the **ID labels correct**?

* Are they to **scale**? (for size-integrated analyses)

* Are **sliders** defined? (if using sliding semi-landmarks)

### Importance of a code-book

* Ensure all your meta-data is **clear**, **easy to understand** and **formatted appropriately**

#Stage 5: Data Registration (isolating shape)

A variety of analyses are available in GMM:

1. **Landmark Analysis** (using landmarks)

2. **Outline Analysis** (using semi-landmarks)

  * **Elliptic Fourier Analysis** (semi-landmarks of a closed outline)
  
  * **Radii Fourier Analysis** (semi-landmarks of a closed outline)
  
  * **Discrete Cosine Transform** (semi-landmarks of an open outline)
  
3. **Miscellaneous** 

  * **Eigenshape Analysis** (semi-landmarks of a closed outline)
  
<br>

<center> The registration method changes depending on if you're analysing landmarks or outlines! <center/>

### Generalised Procrustes Analysis
<br> 
The raw coordinates (for all shapes) are‚Ä¶

* Translated to a **common centroid** (A-B)

* Scaled to a **common centroid size** (B-C)

* Rotated to **minimise the sum of <br> squared-distances between landmarks** (C-D) <br/>

* Outcome: **Procrustes coordinates** (shape)
<br/>

.pull-left[## Why Procrustes?

* Damastes was a son of Poseidon <br> who lived on a sacred way (Attica)

* There he had a bed, in which he invited every passer-by to spend the night. He would set to work on them with his blacksmith's hammer, to stretch them to "fit" the bed

* Nickname: Procrustes ("The Stretcher")

* If the guest proved too tall, Procrustes would amputate the excess length - nobody ever fitted the bed exactly! (**Procrustes Fitting**)

* Procrustes continued his reign of terror until he was  "fitted" to his own bed by Theseus!

# Fourier-based transformation 

In these methods, the **semi-landmarks are converted into curves**, <br> and the **coefficients which quantify these curves** are what we examine. <br> For example, in **Elliptic Fourier Analysis (EFA)** *sensu* Kuhl and Giardina (1982)... <br/>

.footnote[ k = the **total number of steps around the outline** <br> n = the **harmonic number** <br> ‚àÜx = the **displacement** between point p and p+1 <br> ‚àÜt = the **length of the step** between point p and p+1 <br> tp = **accumulated length** of step segments at point <br> pT = **sum of lengths** of all steps around outline <br><br>]

# Visualising Shape Change

* Useful for comparing **individual** and **mean** shapes

* Shape change can be represented as:

  * Deformation grids
  
  * Contours
  
  * Outlines
  
  * Lollipop sticks
  
  * Vectors

# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

* Often the **first exploratory procedure**

* **Ordination (multi-dimensional)** method

* Each coordinate configuration = a shape

* **Principal components = sources of shape variation**

* Axis origin (0,0) = **mean shape**

* Scree plots (for examining PC contributions)

* **Important: total within-group variance is examined <br> and not between-group variance! (factors overlay the plot!)**

## Discriminant Analysis (DA)

* Otherwise known as **Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA)** or...

  * **Linear Discriminant Analysis** (LDA)
  
  * **Canonical Variate Analysis** (CVA)
  
* Investigates *a priori* classification through <br> **maximum between-group classification** <br/>

* Percentage = success of classifier (as based on group data)

* **Jacknifed percentage** üëàüëàüëà 

  * **Leave-one-out cross-validation**
  
  * **Success with which a random shape can be correctly classified**

## <center> Technical Notes and Suggestions <center/>

Principal Component Analysis: consider **between-groups PCA (bgPCA)**

Discriminant Analysis: consider **Kovarovic et al. 2011** (notes on sample size!)

Other cool methods:

1) **Machine Learning** (Unsupervised vs. Supervised classificatory methods)

2) **Bayesian Approaches** to GMM

3) **Partial Least Squares (PLS) and Modularity Studies**

.footnote[Kovarovic et al. (2011). Discriminant function analyses in archaeology: are classification rates too good to be true? <br> *Journal of Archaeological Science*, 38: 3008-3018. doi: 10.1016/j.jas.2011.06.028]
